# Testing Instructions for Admin Panel

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Removed corrupted code** - Cleaned up duplicate/malformed functions
2. **Fixed initialization order** - `initUserManagement()` now runs before `loadInitialData()`
3. **Fixed user table rendering** - `window.users` is properly initialized before rendering
4. **No syntax errors** - JavaScript file is now clean and error-free

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Open the Admin Panel
```
Open: /Users/jiya/odoo_hackathon25/static/src/admin.html
```

Or use Live Server and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5500/static/src/admin.html
```

### 2. Test Add User Feature

1. **Check User Table**
   - You should see 4 sample users in the table:
     - John Doe (Admin)
     - Jane Smith (Manager)
     - Bob Johnson (Employee)
     - Alice Williams (Employee - Inactive)

2. **Add a New User**
   - Click the "+ Add User" button (top right)
   - Fill in the form:
     - First Name: "Test"
     - Last Name: "User"
     - Email: "test.user@example.com"
     - Role: Select "Employee"
     - Status: Keep "Active" selected
   - Click "Save User"
   - You should see:
     - Success notification
     - Modal closes
     - New user appears in the table
     - User count increases to 5

### 3. Test Workflow Features

1. **Navigate to Workflow Builder**
   - Click "Approval Workflows" in the sidebar

2. **Test New Workflow**
   - Click "+ New Workflow" button
   - Confirm the dialog
   - Canvas should clear
   - Success notification appears

3. **Test Save Workflow**
   - Drag some components to the canvas (if drag-drop works)
   - Click "Save Workflow" button
   - Success notification appears
   - Check browser console for saved workflow data

4. **Test Workflow**
   - Add some nodes to the canvas
   - Click "Test Workflow" button
   - Nodes should highlight with green borders sequentially
   - Success notification at the end

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If User Table is Empty
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Type: `console.log(window.users)`
4. You should see an array with 4 users

### If Add User Doesn't Work
1. Open browser console
2. Click "+ Add User"
3. Fill form and submit
4. Check console for any errors
5. Type: `console.log(window.users.length)` - should increase

### If Notifications Don't Show
1. Check if notification element exists in HTML
2. Look for `<div id="notification">` in the page
3. Check browser console for CSS errors

## ‚ú® Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ User table loads with 4 sample users
- ‚úÖ Add User button opens modal
- ‚úÖ Form validation works (required fields)
- ‚úÖ New users appear in table immediately
- ‚úÖ Success notifications show for all actions
- ‚úÖ Workflow buttons work without errors
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript console errors

## üìù Notes

- All data is stored in `window.users` array (in-memory)
- Data will be lost on page refresh
- No backend required - pure JavaScript
- All features work offline
