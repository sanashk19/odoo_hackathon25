## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Button doesn't respond
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for button click log message
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Verify button element exists in HTML

### Test Workflow shows warning
- **Message**: "Please add nodes to the workflow before testing"
- **Solution**: Add workflow nodes to the canvas first
- The canvas needs to have elements with class `.workflow-node`

### Notifications don't show
- Check if `showNotification` function exists
- Verify notification element exists in HTML
- Check browser console for errors

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check if functions exist
console.log({
  saveWorkflow: typeof saveWorkflow,
  createNewWorkflow: typeof createNewWorkflow,
  testWorkflow: typeof testWorkflow,
  publishWorkflow: typeof publishWorkflow
});

// Manually trigger functions
createNewWorkflow();  // Opens new workflow dialog
saveWorkflow();       // Saves current workflow
testWorkflow();       // Tests workflow (needs nodes)
publishWorkflow();    // Publishes workflow
```
